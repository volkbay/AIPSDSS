This code belongs to a thesis work to detect scratch objects on a mirror-like metallic surfaces. The study targets to run on an actual product line in a dishwasher plant. As a results, the challenges are (1) operating in real-time and fast and (2) scrathes hard to spotted by naked eye. The project partner is [ArÃ§elik](https://www.arcelikglobal.com/en/technology/rd/rd-and-design-centers/).
